This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). __(Underdevelopment)__

## What is it ?

RSourah is a web application for Muslims who want to concentrate in their prayer and allows them to randomly choose suras. The logic behind the application is that a Muslim who concentrates 5 minutes before the beginning of the prayer will surely concentrate in the rest of the prayer. And to do so, before starting the prayer, he is allowed to reflect on his prayer by helping him to choose the suras he will read in the first two rakaat.


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Tools

Tools used : __Next.js, Chakra UI, Lingui.js__

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
